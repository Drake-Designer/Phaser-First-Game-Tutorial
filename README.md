# 🎮 Phaser Tutorial Game

**Phaser Tutorial Game** is a guided project I created to learn the basics of Phaser 3 and build my very first 2D platformer game with JavaScript. This project walks me through loading assets, setting up the game scene, adding platforms, creating a player, and implementing basic game logic.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository is split into two main parts:

- **Tutorial Walkthrough** (up to commit: `GAME.JS: Add bombs, game over logic and score system`): All commits up to this point closely follow the official [Phaser 3 First Game Tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1), step by step.
- **Personal Customizations** (after that commit):  
  Everything added after the `GAME.JS: Add bombs, game over logic and score system` commit is my own work and experimentation to further customize, style, and improve the base game.  
  This includes things like:

  - UI and design tweaks
  - Responsive layout and custom borders
  - Improved navigation and header
  - Extra game features
