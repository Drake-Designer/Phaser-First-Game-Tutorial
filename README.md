# 🎮 Phaser Tutorial Game

**Phaser Tutorial Game** is a guided project I created to learn the basics of Phaser 3 and build my very first 2D platformer game with JavaScript. This project walks me through loading assets, setting up the game scene, adding platforms, creating a player, and implementing basic game logic.
